# Part 1 - Introduction

As I already have too many side projects, I decided to start yet another one - trying to keep it simple this time, building a short piece of interactive fiction from scratch in Javascript.

After sketching out the story in my journal, I set up the folder structure for the project: inside the `[2016-11-07] voidfire_apprentice` folder I created five more folders, `css`, `data`, `dist` (for libraries), `js` and `writing`.

I found and downloaded in `dist` the libraries that I would be using - Zepto, Marked and Mustache, created two minimal `index.html` and `main.css` files, inizialized a git repository and added a `.gitignore` file.
